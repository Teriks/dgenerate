        Alias for: --sub-command to-diffusers

        Convert single file diffusion model checkpoints from CivitAI and elsewhere into diffusers format (a folder on disk with configuration).

        This can be useful if you want to load a single file checkpoint with quantization.

        You may also save models loaded from Hugging Face repos.

        Examples:

        \\to_diffusers "all_in_one.safetensors" --model-type torch --output model_directory

        \\to_diffusers "https://modelsite.com/all_in_one.safetensors" --model-type torch-sdxl --output model_directory

        See: \\to_diffusers --help

        This does not cause the config to exit.
