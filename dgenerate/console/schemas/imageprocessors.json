It should be a\n    single dimension for example: \"detect-resolution=512\" or the X/Y dimensions seperated by an \"x\" character, like so: \"detect-resolution=1024x512\".\n    If you do not specify this argument, the detector runs on the input image at its full resolution. After processing the image will be resized to\n    whatever you have requested dgenerate resize it to via --output-size or --resize/--align in the case of the image-process sub-command, if you have\n    not requested any resizing the output will be resized back to the original size of the input image.\n\n    The argument \"detect-aspect\" determines if the image resize requested by \"detect-resolution\" before detection runs is aspect correct, this\n    defaults to true.\n\n    The argument \"detect-align\" determines the pixel alignment of the image resize requested by \"detect-resolution\", it defaults to 1 indicating no\n    requested alignment.\n\n    The \"pre-resize\" argument determines if the processing occurs before or after dgenerate resizes the image. This defaults to False, meaning the\n    image is processed after dgenerate is done resizing it."}, "solarize": {"threshold": {"optional": false, "types": ["int"], "default": 128}, "pre-resize": {"optional": false, "types": ["bool"], "default": false}, "PROCESSOR_HELP": "solarize:\n    arguments:\n        threshold: int = 128\n        pre-resize: bool = False\n\n    Solarize the input image with PIL.ImageOps.solarize.\n\n    Accepts the argument \"threshold\" which is an integer value from 0 to 255.\n\n    The \"pre-resize\" argument determines if the processing occurs before or after dgenerate resizes the image.

Specifying 'auto'\n    indicates that this value should be calculated based off available GPU memory if applicable. Specifying 0 disables tiling entirely.\n\n    The \"overlap\" argument can be used to specify the overlap amount of each tile in pixels, it must be greater than or equal to 0, and defaults to\n    32.\n\n    The \"force-tiling\" argument can be used to force external image tiling for upscaler model architectures which discourage the use of external\n    tiling (SCUNEt and MixDehazeNet currently), this may mean that the model needs information about the whole image to achieve a good result.\n    External tiling breaks up the image into tiles before feeding it to the model and reassembles the images output by the model, this is not the\n    default behavior when a model specifies that tiling is discouraged, tiling is only on by default for models where external tiling is fully\n    supported. Only use this if you run into memory issues with models that discourage external tiling, in the case that the model discourages its\n    use, using it may result in substandard image output.\n\n    The \"dtype\" argument can be used to specify the datatype to use to for the model in memory, it can be either \"float32\" or \"float16\". Using\n    \"float16\" will result in a smaller memory footprint if supported.\n\n    The \"pre-resize\" argument is a boolean value determining if the processing should take place before or after the image is resized by dgenerate.\n\n    Example: \"upscaler;model=my-model.pth;tile=256;overlap=16\""}}
