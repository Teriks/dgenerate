class UpscalerProcessor(_imageprocessor.ImageProcessor):
    """
    Implements tiled upscaling with chaiNNer compatible upscaler models.

    The "model" argument should be a path to a chaiNNer compatible upscaler model on disk,
    such as a model downloaded from https://openmodeldb.info/, or an HTTP/HTTPS URL
    that points to a raw model file.

    For example: "upscaler;model=https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases/download/v0.2.5.0/realesr-general-x4v3.pth"

    Downloaded models are cached in the dgenerate web cache on disk until the
    cache expiry time for the file is met.

    The "tile" argument can be used to specify the tile size for tiled upscaling, it must be divisible by 2, and
    defaults to 512. Specifying 'auto' indicates that this value should be calculated based off available GPU
    memory if applicable. Specifying 0 disables tiling entirely.

    The "overlap" argument can be used to specify the overlap amount of each tile in pixels, it must be
    greater than or equal to 0, and defaults to 32.

    The "scale" argument can be used to specify the output scale of the image regardless of the models
    scale, this equates to an image resize on each tile output of the model as necessary, with auto selected
    resizing algorithm for the best quality. This is effectively equivalent to basic image resizing of
    the upscaled output post upscale, just with somewhat reduced memory overhead as it occurs during tiling.
    When this argument is not specified, the scale of the model architecture is used and no resizing occurs.
    This argument must be greater than or equal to 1.

    The "force-tiling" argument can be used to force external image tiling for upscaler model architectures which
    discourage the use of external tiling (SCUNEt and MixDehazeNet currently), this may mean that the model needs
    information about the whole image to achieve a good result. External tiling breaks up the image into tiles
    before feeding it to the model and reassembles the images output by the model, this is not the default behavior
    when a model specifies that tiling is discouraged, tiling is only on by default for models where external tiling is
    fully supported. Only use this if you run into memory issues with models that discourage external tiling, in the
    case that the model discourages its use, using it may result in substandard image output.

    The "dtype" argument can be used to specify the datatype to use to for the model in memory, it can be
    either "float32" or "float16". Using "float16" will result in a smaller memory footprint if supported.

    The "pre-resize" argument is a boolean value determining if the processing should take place before or
    after the image is resized by dgenerate.

    Example: "upscaler;model=my-model.pth;tile=256;overlap=16"
