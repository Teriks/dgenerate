"""
Cache constraint expressions for when to attempt to clear cuda VRAM
upon a image processor plugin calling :py:meth:`dgenerate.imageprocessors.ImageProcessor.memory_guard_device`
on a cuda device, syntax provided via :py:func:`dgenerate.memory.cuda_memory_constraints`

If any of these constraints are met, an effort is made to clear modules off a GPU
which are cached for fast repeat usage but are okay to flush.

The only available extra variable is: ``memory_required``, which is the
amount of memory the image processor plugin requested to be available.
