class CannyEdgeDetectProcessor(_imageprocessor.ImageProcessor):
    """
    Process the input image with the Canny edge detection algorithm
    .
    The "lower" argument indicates the lower threshold value for the algorithm, and the "upper"
    argument indicates the upper threshold. "aperture-size" is the size of Sobel kernel used for find image gradients,
    it must be an odd integer from 3 to 7. "L2-gradient" specifies the equation for finding gradient magnitude,
    if True a more accurate equation is used. See: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/da/d22/tutorial_py_canny.html.

    If "blur" is true, apply a 3x3 gaussian blur before processing. If "gray" is true, convert the image to the cv2
    "GRAY" format before processing, which does not happen automatically unless you are using a "threshold_algo" value,
    OpenCV is capable of edge detection on colored images, however you may find better results by converting to its
    internal grayscale format before processing, or you may not, it depends.

    If "threshold_algo" is one of ("otsu", "triangle", "median") try to calculate the lower and upper threshold
    automatically using cv2.threshold or cv2.median in the case of "median". "sigma" scales the range of the automatic
    threshold calculation done when a value for "threshold_algo" is selected. "pre-resize" is a boolean value determining
    if the processing should take place before or after the image is resized by dgenerate.

    The argument "detect-resolution" is the resolution the image is resized to internal to the processor before
    detection is run on it. It should be a single dimension for example: "detect-resolution=512" or the X/Y dimensions
    seperated by an "x" character, like so: "detect-resolution=1024x512". If you do not specify this argument,
    the detector runs on the input image at its full resolution. After processing the image will be resized to
    whatever you have requested dgenerate resize it to via --output-size or --resize/--align in the case of the
    image-process sub-command, if you have not requested any resizing the output will be resized back to the original
    size of the input image.

    The argument "detect-aspect" determines if the image resize requested by "detect-resolution" before
    detection runs is aspect correct, this defaults to true.

    The argument "detect-align" determines the pixel alignment of the image resize requested by
    "detect-resolution", it defaults to 1 indicating no requested alignment.

    The "pre-resize" argument determines if the processing occurs before or after dgenerate resizes the image.
    This defaults to False, meaning the image is processed after dgenerate is done resizing it.
