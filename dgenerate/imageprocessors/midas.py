class MidasDepthProcessor(_imageprocessor.ImageProcessor):
    """
    MiDaS depth detector and normal map generation.

    The "normals" argument determines if this processor produces a normal map or a depth image.

    The "alpha" argument is related to normal map generation.

    The "background_threshold" argument is related to normal map generation.

    The "detect-resolution" argument is the resolution the image is resized to internal to the processor before
    detection is run on it. It should be a single dimension for example: "detect-resolution=512" or the X/Y dimensions
    seperated by an "x" character, like so: "detect-resolution=1024x512". If you do not specify this argument,
    the detector runs on the input image at its full resolution. After processing the image will be resized to
    whatever you have requested dgenerate resize it to via --output-size or --resize/--align in the case of the
    image-process sub-command, if you have not requested any resizing the output will be resized back to the original
    size of the input image.

    The "detect-aspect" argument determines if the image resize requested by "detect_resolution" before
    detection runs is aspect correct, this defaults to true.

    The "pre-resize" argument determines if the processing occurs before or after dgenerate resizes the image.
    This defaults to False, meaning the image is processed after dgenerate is done resizing it.
