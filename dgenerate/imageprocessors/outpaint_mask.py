    Create a mask that can be used to extend the incoming image.

    The "box" argument is the size of the outer mask as it extends from the inner image,
    This may be specified as a uniform pixel padding "WIDTHxHEIGHT", or as a
    four part padding "LEFTxTOPxRIGHTxBOTTOM", you may also specify padding width and
    height simultaneously with a single integer.

    The "pre-resize" argument determines if the processing occurs before or after dgenerate resizes the image.
    This defaults to False, meaning the image is processed after dgenerate is done resizing it.
