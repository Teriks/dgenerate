These pipelines are vendored from UltraEdit: https://github.com/HaozheZhao/UltraEdit

Each pipeline has a slightly different attribution under the Apache-2.0 license.

These pipelines support inpainting unlike the pipelines that exist in the main diffusers library.

SD3 Support does not exist in the main diffusers library but exists here.

The pipeline interface is slightly modernized to match the main diffusers library interface, mainly: mask_img -> mask_image
