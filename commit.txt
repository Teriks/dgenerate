Add Flux Kontext support, fix a few Flux bugs #58

Add Flux Kontext support

sd-embed now works for Flux Fill / Flux Kontext

All flux models now support negative prompting

Fix incorrect output size for Flux/SD3 in img2img/inpaint modes.

Flux and SD3 have output sizes unrelated to image input size,
we just need to make sure all incoming images are the same size
and aligned correctly, we do not need to resize them.

--output-size is fed to the pipeline width/height with aspect
correction based on the input image size.  This can be disabled
with --no-aspect, allowing your input images to differ in size
from your output images.

If you do not supply --output-size, the size of the input image
will be used as the output size, which mimics the behavior of
other pipelines like Stable Diffusion.

The input image will not be resized like with other pipelines,
allowing the transformer of Flux / SD3 to better understand
the image in its original form / size.
