# We can run this same prompt over multiple images in batch on the GPU
# by using the "images: ..." syntax of --image-seeds

# here we are using inpainting, we can specify a mask associated with
# each input image individually if we wanted, but only one is specified,
# so it is used with ever input image.

# all images involved must be the same dimension or resized to the same dimension

# Two images are produced on the GPU in once go, --vae-tiling and --vae-slicing
# is used to reduce memory usage upon VAE decode

# The first image will yield a cat on a bench, and the second will have a cat
# on a very squashed image of a beach

# If we wanted we could use --batch-grid-size to put these images into a grid
