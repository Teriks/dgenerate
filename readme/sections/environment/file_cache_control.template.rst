File Cache Control
==================

dgenerate will cache downloaded non hugging face models, downloaded ``--image-seeds`` files,
files downloaded by the ``\download`` directive, ``download`` template function, and downloaded
files used by image processors in the directory ``~/.cache/dgenerate/web``

On Windows this equates to: ``%USERPROFILE%\.cache\dgenerate\web``

You can control where these files are cached with the environmental variable ``DGENERATE_WEB_CACHE``.

Files are cleared from the web cache automatically after an expiry time upon running dgenerate or
when downloading additional files, the default value is after 12 hours.

This can be controlled with the environmental variable ``DGENERATE_WEB_CACHE_EXPIRY_DELTA``.

The value of ``DGENERATE_WEB_CACHE_EXPIRY_DELTA`` is that of the named arguments of pythons
`datetime.timedelta <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects>`_ class
seperated by semicolons.

For example: ``DGENERATE_WEB_CACHE_EXPIRY_DELTA="days=5;hours=6"``

Specifying ``"forever"`` or an empty string will disable cache expiration for every downloaded file.

Files downloaded from huggingface by the diffusers/huggingface_hub library will be cached under
``~/.cache/huggingface/``, on Windows this equates to ``%USERPROFILE%\.cache\huggingface\``.

This is controlled by the environmental variable ``HF_HOME``

In order to specify that all large model files be stored in another location,
for example on another disk, simply set ``HF_HOME`` to a new path in your environment.

You can read more about environmental variables that affect huggingface libraries on this
`huggingface documentation page <https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/environment_variables>`_.
