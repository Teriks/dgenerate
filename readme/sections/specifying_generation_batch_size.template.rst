Specifying Generation Batch Size
================================

Multiple image variations from the same seed can be produce on a GPU simultaneously
using the ``--batch-size`` option of dgenerate. This can be used in combination with
``--batch-grid-size`` to output image grids if desired.

When not writing to image grids the files in the batch will be written to disk
with the suffix ``_image_N`` where N is index of the image in the batch of images
that were generated.

When producing an animation, you can either write ``N`` animation output files
with the filename suffixes ``_animation_N`` where ``N`` is the index of the image
in the batch which makes up the frames.  Or you can use ``--batch-grid-size`` to
write frames to a single animated output where the frames are all image grids
produced from the images in the batch.

With larger ``--batch-size`` values, the use of ``--vae-slicing`` can make the difference
between an out of memory condition and success, so it is recommended that you
try this option if you experience an out of memory condition due to the use of
``--batch-size``.
