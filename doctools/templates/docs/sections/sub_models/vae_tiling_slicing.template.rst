VAE Tiling and Slicing
======================

You can use ``--vae-tiling`` and ``--vae-slicing`` to enable to generation of huge images
without running your GPU out of memory. Note that if you are using ``--control-nets`` you may
still be memory limited by the size of the image being processed by the ControlNet, and still
may run in to memory issues with large image inputs.

When ``--vae-tiling`` is used, the VAE will split the input tensor into tiles to
compute decoding and encoding in several steps. This is useful for saving a large amount of
memory and to allow processing larger images.

When ``--vae-slicing`` is used, the VAE will split the input tensor in slices to
compute decoding in several steps. This is useful to save some memory, especially
when ``--batch-size`` is greater than 1.
